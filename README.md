# Sokoban
SOKOBANGAME WOOO


This is my sokoban Game. I followed the concept behind sokoban of placing boxes in the correct places but I added additional mechanics and behaviors.

In my game you control a gummy bear using WASD/ arrow keys. Your goal is to move green jellies, and whales to the right spots to advance to the next level. 

In order to do this you have to move your bear throughout the level around barriers, pushing jellies into the correct spot. When you touch a whale it will slide instead of being pushed. There are also sushi blocks that can be made tangible and intangible using a purple circle that a player or a jelly can stand on. 

Something to note is that jellies cannot go through clouds, but whales and the player can.

If you need to you can press R to restart the level.

I added some particle systems for transitioning between stages, I added animations for certain sprites. I also added mechanics such as whales, sushi blocks, gates, and I added clouds that only collide with certain game objects.
